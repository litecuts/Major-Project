# Project Reflection

## Shortage Of Time 

- The first problem which I came across with was the shortage of Time, During this time there was a lot of things going on and I wasn't able to put my whole attention To Computer Science which caused some problems in finishing my project successfully. I would most certainly do much better if I had gotten a bit more time

## Grid not changing 
- In my Project I had made a few levels which were to be interacted by the player. The levels were loaded and made fine but the problem which I came across was that I couldn't get past Level 2,The bubbles were increasing and were getting popped but the grid wasn't changing

## Completed Everything?
- Although My project isn't the best and is certainly not that great for what I could offer but I was thankfully able to complete everything on my Needs to do list and some off my Nice to have list
